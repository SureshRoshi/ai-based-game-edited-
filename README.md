## Fall Ball - AI BASED GAME :
- This is a ball game , which the ball moves according to our commands.(i.e.,Left or Right)
- Before this , i.e., with the existing model of this game you can play with keyboard keys.
- But after applying this model , you can play by giving audio commands i.e., Left or Right (PS : Still you can use keys.) .
- if you address to move to left , the ball moves towards the left.
- if you address to move to right , the ball moves towards the right.
